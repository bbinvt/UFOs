# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This objective for this project is to produce an interactive website allowing a user to filter data from a UFO data set. The underlying mechanics of this project utilize Java Script, the table is displayed in HTML format making it easy for the user to interact with.  

### Project Resources
- The Java Script logic is contained here: [challengeApp.js](https://github.com/bbinvt/UFOs/blob/49df6a05b1647890e6ccfa2e15d07eddfb42f309/JavaScript/challengeApp.js)
- The HTML index is contained here: [challengeIndex.html](https://github.com/bbinvt/UFOs/blob/49df6a05b1647890e6ccfa2e15d07eddfb42f309/challengeIndex.html)
- The Website styling is contained here: [style.css](https://github.com/bbinvt/UFOs/blob/49df6a05b1647890e6ccfa2e15d07eddfb42f309/static/CSS/style.css)
- The data set for this project is contained here: [data.js](https://github.com/bbinvt/UFOs/blob/49df6a05b1647890e6ccfa2e15d07eddfb42f309/JavaScript/data.js)

## Results

#### Getting Started with the Website
The website itself is fairly intuitive to use - upon loading the webpage the user can see a table filled with many rows of data. To the lefthand side the user has inputs to begin filtering the data based on different criteria.

#### Filtering the Data
When the user wants to search for a particular attribute from the dataset they can input their desired filter criteria and the page will data table will update automatically.

#### Changing Filtered Data
To change the filtered data, the user simply has to update their search criteria. If they wish to see the original table they can delete their inputs from the search fields and the table will revert to its initial values.

## Summary
#### One Drawback
There is one annoyance when using this website - when a user has filled in multiple filter criteria and would like to revert back to the original table they must individually delete the text from each textbox.

#### Two additional developments
1. Building a 'Clear Search Criteria' button would improve the user experience. 
2. Create a dynamic filter for "Duration" - ie being able to filter for times between 5 minutes and 10 minutes etc.
